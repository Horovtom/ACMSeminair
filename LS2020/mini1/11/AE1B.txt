 Byteman works as a carpenter. He has just received an order for s pine-wood tables. Although he has plenty of pine-wood boards in his workshop, he has just run out of screws. Therefore he needs to walk to the warehouse and bring back some boxes with screws. What is the minimum number of boxes that he needs to bring in order to have enough screws to make the tables?
Input

The first line of the standard input contains three integers n, k, and s (1 ≤ n, k, s ≤ 1000) separated with single spaces. They denote the number of boxes with screws in Byteman's warehouse, the number of screws needed to make a table and the number of tables to be made by Byteman, respectively. The second line contains n (not necessarily different) integers ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ 1000) separated with single spaces, such that ai is the number of screws in the ith box in the warehouse.
Output

The first and only line of the standard output should contain a single integer - the minimal number of boxes with screws that Byteman needs to bring from his warehouse in order to make s tables. You may assume that Byteman has enough screws in the warehouse to make all tables.
